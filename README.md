KG-BART: Knowledge Graph-Augmented BART for Generative Commonsense Reasoning

## 0. Introduction
This is the official code base for the models in our paper on generative commonsense reasoning:

Ye Liu, Yao Wan, Lifang He, Hao Peng, Philip S. Yu. KG-BART: Knowledge Graph-Augmented BART for Generative Commonsense Reasoning. In AAAI 2021. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12677) This code base is designed to reproduce our experiments in our paper, and can be used with other datasets. For any technical details, please refer to our paper.
When using our code or the methods, please cite our paper: [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12677).
